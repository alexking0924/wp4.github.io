                <h2>Create a Proposal and Present it to the President of UNLV</h2>
                    <p>
                        The President of UNLV is main person in charge of the university. He is the person to talk to if any major changes were to be implemented on campus. That is why he would be the ideal person to talk to about this issue. A proposal can be written up explaining why it is important to allow students to freely speak their minds and the last page can have signatures of several students who read the proposal and support it. The proposal would have to be very professional and well-written since it will be presented to UNLV’s President.

                <h3>Why Would This Work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        This solution is the most direct, so if it works, then the payoff will be great. If this solution works, then the success will most likely be based off the fact that UNLV’s President will be impressed with how professional it is. Talking to him directly about the issue will also help him understand the importance of fixing the issue. It shows that initiative is being taken to solve the problem. This will help impress UNLV’s President because it shows that his students are taking initiative and trying to fix a problem they feel is important to the university and its success.

                <h3>Why Would This Not Work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The President of UNLV is in charge. Whatever he says is what goes. He wants the students of UNLV to be successful and work for the things they want, but he also has to make sure that the campus is not engulfed in chaos. Allowing free speech anywhere on campus can cause a lot of chaos. Take the Fire and Brimstone people for example; if they were allowed to leave the free speech walkway and scream at people all around campus, would that not create a chaotic environment? That is one of the big reasons why this solution will not work. UNLV’s President may admire the students for taking a stand, but ultimately he has to think about what is best for the university as a whole and restricting free speech may be just the thing that keeps the university from spiraling out of control.
