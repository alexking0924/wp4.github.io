                <h2>The Importance of Free Speech</h2>
                <p>
                    College campuses are places of intellect, inquiry, and academic success. According to firstamendmentcenter.org, free speech on college campuses should be promoted because it helps encourage academic inquiry and it teaches students to question what they know. Students cannot really question things if their right to free speech is inhibited. “Moreover, one of the driving concepts of the university campus is academic freedom, the right to inquire broadly, to question and to promote an environment where wrong answers, seemingly absurd ideas and unconventional thought are not just permitted but even encouraged” (firstamendmentcenter.org). Even with academic inquiry, there is too much emphasis on finding “the right answers”. Nobody cares about what is being said if they do not think it is the right answer. But having this mindset in an academic setting where higher education is taking place does not do any good. Preventing people from reaching their academic potential is another way of inhibiting their free speech. It is okay to question things that are already in existence and it is okay to try out something new and have it end up being the wrong solution.

                    Aside from encouraging students in reaching their academic potential, it also encourages personal growth. UNLV is ranked second in the country for campus diversity. If the University hinders free speech, campus diversity decrease. Diversity does not just relate to different ethnic groups and cultural backgrounds, it also deals with the different ideas and opinions everyone has. Free speech allows students to share their ideas and opinions. Campus diversity is in direct correlation with free speech. The more encouragement for free speech there is, the more diverse the campus will be because the students will share their different ideas.
