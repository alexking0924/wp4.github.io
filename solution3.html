                <h2>Hold University-sponsored Workshops Promoting the Importance of Free Speech</h2>
                    <p>
                        University-sponsored workshops can be very effective. They would be held on campus, which will make it easy for students to attend. The workshops provide another way for students to get involved outside of the classroom. Different guest speakers will come in and lead the workshops and they will be a fun, informative way to encourage students to express themselves. Attendance to the workshops will not be mandatory, so they will not be a hassle for students. It seems like something college students would be interested in so students will attend.

                <h3>Why Would This Work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The workshops will provide a fun and engaging way for students to learn about the importance of expressing themselves. Attendance will not be mandatory so students will not feel forced to go. The workshops will also provide new opportunities to meet new people and be exposed to different types of people due to the fact that they will be focused around free expression. The workshops will also appeal to the students that thoroughly enjoy getting involved on campus due to the fact that they are workshops being offered for the university’s students. Because UNLV is a public university, people who do not attend the university can still attend the workshops if they want to.

                <h3>Why Would This Not Work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are a number of reasons why this solution will not work. First, it can be very difficult finding exciting guest speakers to run the workshops. Lots of research will have to be done about who would want to be involved and who is knowledgeable about the topic. Second, it may not be something students are interested in attending. Sure, it provides another way for students to get involved on campus, but who actually cares about the topic of the workshops? The workshops will not be effective unless students attend. If students do not attend, then it will have been a waste of time not only for the university but for the guest speakers as well. Third, the workshops will have to be scheduled around already decided activities on campus. The workshops will be a new addition and replacing campus activity with these workshops will not be a great idea. So scheduling days and times for the workshops that will work for students’ schedules will be difficult.
