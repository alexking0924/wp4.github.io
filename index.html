                    One of the problems at UNLV is the lack of encouragement for free speech around campus. Along the free speech walkway, there are different groups of people
                    that share their messages. However, this is a miniscule portion of the UNLV campus. Because of this, students feel as though free speech is not encouraged
                    all around campus. This can be problematic because if students feel as though they do not have a voice, then they will not be engaged in college life or their
                    studies. Below are a couple graphs created from a survey taken asking students how they feel about free speech on campus.

                    Free speech on campus is important because college students have the ability that many do not have in their professional lives. This ability is to get their voices heard and create change that students may feel is needed in society. In order to achieve free speech, it is important that the university does not restrict students from it. In this website, there are a few solutions that may be beneficial to allow students to speak freely all around campus.
