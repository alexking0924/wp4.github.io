                <h2>Publish an Article in the Rebel Yell</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Rebel Yell is the the official UNLV newspaper. There are stands all around campus where students and faculty can pick up a copy. The article would not be attacking the university for restricting the studentsâ€™ First Amendment rights. It would simply be an informative article about why it is important for students to be able to freely express themselves. This will prevent any sort of conflicts that could arise from the article being published.

                <h3>Why Would This Work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        As it was previously stated, the Rebel Yell is the official newspaper for UNLV. It is always filled with many different things pertaining to life on and around campus. Because of this, there is a good amount of students and faculty that read it. Publishing an article about the importance of free speech would be an effective way to make the students aware of the importance of their ability to express themselves. Allowing students to express themselves freely will help them do well in academics. An increase in academic success within the university will help its educational ranking and ultimately attract more students in the future.

                <h3>Why Would This Not Work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although the Rebel Yell is the official newspaper of the university, reading the newspaper is a very outdated form of gaining information. Being able to get an article published would probably be easy, but there would be no guarantee of how many students would read it. With the technology available, young adults tend to turn towards social media and online mediums to receive news and read articles. It is not common for a young adult to be seen reading a newspaper. Young adults typically stare at an electronic screen, whether it be a smartphone, laptop, tablet, etc., to read articles.
